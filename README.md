# BigBanger

BigBanger is an ESP32-based open-source project that combines firmware and hardware to create a Bluetooth-enabled scale, mainly designed for climbing training.

This scale is fully compatible with the [Tindeq Progressor API](https://tindeq.com/progressor_api/), enabling easy integration with apps that support them, including the official Tindeq Progressor app.

The BigBanger PCB should replace seamlessly PCBs of cheap scales that you can buy on Amazon/Aliexpress, like [this one](https://it.aliexpress.com/item/1005004488455473.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.45.6640ebyYebyYDH&algo_pvid=4eb4987b-360f-48ef-b21f-248b90a92ae2&algo_exp_id=4eb4987b-360f-48ef-b21f-248b90a92ae2-22&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21EUR%2122.65%2113.59%21%21%2122.91%2113.75%21%40210388c917363545957476762e73f7%2112000029333412625%21sea%21IT%21185384505%21X&curPageLogUid=mN6PXk7hKujt&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A)

This is not the first open-source Tindeq Progressor-like project. The [hangman](https://github.com/kesyog/hangman) is a very similar example. BigBanger was developed from scratch as a personal learning experience.
